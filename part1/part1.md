# Part 1 questions

1. The length of the array `prices` will be printed. Because `var` is scoped in the entire function, `i` is still defined.
2. The last value in the array `prices` multiplied by `1-discount` will be printed. Because `var` is scoped in the function, `discountedPrice` exists in the entire function.
3. The last value in the array `prices` with the applied `discount` value will be printed, rounded to the nearest hundredths. Since `var` is scoped in the function, `finalPrice` is still defined.
